# Sort-Time-Complexity-Analysis
Multiple sorting algorithms will be implemented and tested with different size data types. The visualization will be available through the web usign graphs.

## Goal
I wanted to be able to teach myself more in depth how sorting algorithms work. Many languages today come with built in sorting functions or libraries that make sorting data simple, but with only documentation for a description on how to use them. I learn best by applying what I read from these documentations which is the purpose of this project.

## Sorting Algorithms Implemented
* Insertion Sort
* Selection Sort
* Merge Sort
* Heap Sort

## What I Learned
